# DE-Projects
All my Data Related Project are in this Repo

1) The !st Project I worked on was a data modeling project. Here I install postgres and psycopg2 to enter data in to the postgres database using python. 
I took three csv containing crimes against police personel, jail escapes and victims of rape respectively. This dataset was available on kaggle.com and I'll provide a link to it below.
So i used pandas and converted the csv files to datframes and created a er diagram to get an idea of which columns(attributes) I had to keep and which Attributes to discard.
Finally, after creating the data model i loaded the dataframes into the database.
